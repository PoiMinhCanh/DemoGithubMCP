# DemoGithubMCP

## Overview

DemoGithubMCP is a demonstration repository showcasing the integration and capabilities of GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol). This project serves as a practical example of how AI assistants can interact with GitHub repositories through the MCP framework, enabling seamless automation of development workflows.

## What is GitHub MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that enables AI assistants to interact with various tools and services. The GitHub MCP implementation allows AI models to:

- **Repository Management**: Create, read, and manage GitHub repositories
- **Issue Tracking**: Create, update, and manage issues and pull requests  
- **Code Operations**: Read file contents, create branches, and manage code changes
- **Workflow Automation**: Trigger GitHub Actions and manage CI/CD pipelines
- **Collaboration**: Handle reviews, comments, and team interactions

## Key Features Demonstrated

### ðŸ”§ Repository Operations
- Automated repository creation and configuration
- Branch management and protection rules
- File operations (create, update, delete)
- Repository settings and metadata management

### ðŸ“‹ Issue & Project Management
- Issue creation with templates and labels
- Pull request automation and reviews
- Project boards and milestone tracking
- Automated workflows for common tasks

### ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Development
- Intelligent code suggestions and reviews
- Automated documentation generation
- Smart issue triage and labeling
- Context-aware commit messages

### ðŸ”„ Integration Examples
- GitHub Actions workflow automation
- Third-party service integrations
- API interactions and webhooks
- Custom MCP tool implementations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with appropriate permissions
