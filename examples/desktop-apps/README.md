This directory contains examples of desktop applications that can be created and managed using GitHub MCP integration.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Overview
A complete tic-tac-toe desktop application built with Python and Tkinter, demonstrating:
- GUI application development with Tkinter
- Game logic implementation
- AI opponent with strategic gameplay
- Modern UI design with dark theme
- Score tracking and game state management

### Features
- **Two Game Modes**:
  - Player vs Player: Two human players take turns
  - Player vs Computer: Play against an AI opponent

- **Smart AI Computer Player**:
  - Attempts to win when possible
  - Blocks player from winning
  - Uses strategic positioning (center, corners)
  - Provides challenging but fair gameplay

- **Interactive GUI**:
  - Clean, modern dark theme design
  - Color-coded players (X = red, O = blue)
  - Visual feedback for button interactions
  - Winning combination highlighting

- **Game Management**:
  - Score tracking for players and ties
  - New Game functionality
  - Reset Scores option
  - Current player indicator

### How to Run
1. Ensure Python with Tkinter is installed (included with most Python installations)
2. Navigate to the `examples/desktop-apps/` directory
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python tictactoe.py
   ```

### How to Play
1. Choose your preferred game mode (Player vs Player or Player vs Computer)
2. Click any empty square on the 3x3 grid to make your move
3. X always goes first (red color)
4. Get three symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to win
5. Use control buttons:
   - **New Game**: Start a fresh round
   - **Reset Scores**: Clear the scoreboard
   - **Quit**: Exit the application

### Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (built-in Python library)
- **Architecture**: Object-oriented design with single class structure
- **AI Algorithm**: Minimax-inspired strategy with priority-based decision making
- **Styling**: Custom color scheme with professional appearance

### Code Structure
```python
class TicTacToeGame:
    - __init__(): Initialize game state and UI
    - setup_ui(): Create and configure GUI elements
    - make_move(): Handle player moves and game logic
    - computer_move(): AI move generation
    - get_best_move(): AI strategy implementation
    - check_winner(): Win condition detection
    - Game management methods (reset, scoring, etc.)
```

### Learning Outcomes
This example demonstrates:
- Desktop GUI development with Python
- Event-driven programming patterns
- Game logic and state management
- AI algorithm implementation
- User interface design principles
- Error handling and input validation

### Potential Enhancements
- Add difficulty levels for AI
- Implement multiplayer over network
- Add game statistics and analytics
- Create custom themes and skins
- Add sound effects and animations
- Implement tournament mode
